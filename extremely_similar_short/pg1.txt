Should intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the cosmos, there would be certain universal principles that connect us. Mathematical axioms would be identical, as they hold true by their very nature. Likewise, physical laws such as the weight of a carbon atom would remain constant, regardless of the planet. However, I posit that we might also find shared wisdom with extraterrestrial beings that extends beyond mere mathematics and physics, and it's an intriguing concept to ponder.
Consider, for instance, the likelihood that we would both adhere to the idea that systematic experiments aimed at testing a theory would logically lead to a proportional increase in confidence in that theory. It also seems plausible that the concept of improvement through practice would resonate with intelligent aliens. The principle of Occam's razor might also be a shared belief, as none of these notions seem inherently tied to human nature.
