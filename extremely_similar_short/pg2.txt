In the vast cosmic arena, where stars are born and galaxies collide, one might entertain the idea that intelligent life exists beyond our pale blue dot. The fundamental truths of mathematics, those elegant equations that describe the universe, would resonate with them, for they are universal by nature. The same goes for the constants of physics, such as the unchanging weight of a carbon atom. Yet, I would venture to say that we would find more in common with these distant neighbors than mere equations and atomic weights. The exploration of what these shared truths might be invites us on a journey of cosmic curiosity.
Consider the concept that a methodical, scientific experiment, designed to probe a specific theory, would naturally lead to a corresponding increase in conviction. It seems to me that the principle of improving through repetition would also find common ground with these hypothetical beings. Even something as abstract as Occam's razor could be a shared philosophical standpoint, for these ideas are not confined to the human condition.
