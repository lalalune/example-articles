Should intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the cosmos, there would be certain universal principles that connect us. Mathematical axioms would be identical, as they hold true by their very nature. Likewise, physical laws such as the weight of a carbon atom would remain constant, regardless of the planet. However, I posit that we might also find shared wisdom with extraterrestrial beings that extends beyond mere mathematics and physics, and it's an intriguing concept to ponder.

Consider, for instance, the likelihood that we would both adhere to the idea that systematic experiments aimed at testing a theory would logically lead to a proportional increase in confidence in that theory. It also seems plausible that the concept of improvement through practice would resonate with intelligent aliens. The principle of Occam's razor might also be a shared belief, as none of these notions seem inherently tied to human nature.

Our understanding here is, of course, speculative. The specific manifestations of intelligent life are beyond our current knowledge, and it's not my intention to delve into that subject here, though it is fascinating. What I mean to highlight with the notion of extraterrestrial truth is not a means to hypothesize about alien life forms, but to establish a benchmark or specific aim for truth. If we are to identify truths that transcend those of math or physics, they will likely be those that we hold in common with other intelligent entities.

Utilizing extraterrestrial truth as a guideline, it's wise to lean towards inclusivity. If a concept might feasibly apply to extraterrestrials, such as justice, that suffices. I wouldn't confidently claim that all intelligent life would grasp the notion of justice, but I wouldn't outright dismiss it either.

The concept of alien truth bears resemblance to Erdos's description of God's book. He would often attribute an excellent proof to God's book, suggesting (a) that a superior proof is more unearthed than fabricated, and (b) that its quality would be universally acknowledged. If alien truth exists, then God's book contains more than mere mathematics.

What name should we give this quest for extraterrestrial truth? A fitting term might be "philosophy." Whatever philosophy encompasses, it likely includes this pursuit. I'm convinced that Aristotle would agree. One might even argue that the quest for alien truth could serve as an apt definition for philosophy. The label is less important, though; the pursuit itself is what counts.

We may eventually encounter something akin to alien intelligence in the form of AI. This might enable us to pinpoint the truths that an intelligent entity must share with us. For instance, we might determine that intelligence, as we define it, requires the use of Occam's razor, and we might even prove it one day. While this research would be compelling, it's not essential for our current goal, nor is it the same discipline; the objective of philosophy, if we choose to label it as such, is to explore the ideas that arise when targeting alien truth, not to define its exact boundaries. These two inquiries may eventually align, but until they do, we shouldn't limit ourselves to what we're certain would be extraterrestrial truths. Interestingly, this area might be one where intuition is remarkably close to optimal. (Time will tell.)

No matter the terminology, the endeavor to uncover alien truths is a valuable mission. And interestingly enough, that statement itself likely qualifies as an alien truth.
