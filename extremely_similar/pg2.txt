Suppose that intelligent creatures inhabit other regions of the cosmos; there would be certain universal realities that bind us together. The principles of mathematics would remain unchanged, being inherently true. So would the facts of physics, such as the weight of a carbon atom, which would not vary from one world to another. Yet, I believe we would discover commonalities with beings from other planets that go beyond the realms of math and physics, and it's worth exploring what those might be.

Take, for example, the idea that a well-conducted experiment aimed at examining a particular theory would logically lead to a corresponding boost in our faith in that theory. It also seems reasonable to believe that the notion of honing skills through repetition would be a shared understanding. Principles like Occam's razor might also find common ground, as these concepts don't seem particularly human-centric.

Of course, we are merely hypothesizing here. The exact nature of intelligent beings is something we cannot definitively know, and my focus here is not to investigate that enigma, although it's an engaging thought. Rather, the essence of the term "alien truth" is not to provide a basis for conjecture about the forms of intelligent life but to establish a goal or specific standard for truth. If we aim to discover truths that go beyond those of mathematics or physics, they would likely be the ones we hold in congruence with other intelligent existences.

In applying alien truth as a measure, it is wise to approach with an open mind. If a thought might reasonably pertain to extraterrestrial beings, such as the idea of fairness, that should suffice. I wouldn't confidently affirm that every intelligent existence would grasp the concept of fairness, but I wouldn't rule it out, either.

The notion of alien truth shares a kinship with Erdos's metaphor of God's book. He would often refer to an outstanding proof as part of God's book, signifying (a) that a remarkable proof is more uncovered than crafted, and (b) that its excellence would be universally accepted. If there is such a thing as alien truth, then God's book holds more than just mathematical truths.

What terminology should we assign to this exploration of extraterrestrial truth? A suitable label might be "philosophy." Whatever else philosophy may encompass, it should likely include this exploration. I have little doubt that thinkers like Aristotle would concur. It might even be argued that the quest for alien truth could provide a fitting characterization of philosophy. However, the terminology is secondary; the exploration itself is the primary concern.

We may, in the future, encounter something resembling alien intelligence in artificial forms. This might enable us to identify the fundamental truths that an intelligent existence must comprehend. We might discover, for example, that true intelligence, as we define it, necessitates principles like Occam's razor, and we might even substantiate that claim. While such research would be captivating, it is not essential to our current objectives, nor is it the same area of study; the aim of philosophy, if we choose to name it thus, is to explore concepts that emerge when aiming at alien truth, not to delineate its exact parameters. These two inquiries may one day align, but until that time, we should not confine ourselves to only what we are certain would qualify as extraterrestrial truths. Intriguingly, this area might be one where intuitive insights prove remarkably accurate. (Only time will reveal this.)

Regardless of what we name it, the quest to unearth alien truths is a commendable pursuit. And it's worth noting that this statement itself may well be an alien truth.
