In the vast cosmic arena, where stars are born and galaxies collide, one might entertain the idea that intelligent life exists beyond our pale blue dot. The fundamental truths of mathematics, those elegant equations that describe the universe, would resonate with them, for they are universal by nature. The same goes for the constants of physics, such as the unchanging weight of a carbon atom. Yet, I would venture to say that we would find more in common with these distant neighbors than mere equations and atomic weights. The exploration of what these shared truths might be invites us on a journey of cosmic curiosity.

Consider the concept that a methodical, scientific experiment, designed to probe a specific theory, would naturally lead to a corresponding increase in conviction. It seems to me that the principle of improving through repetition would also find common ground with these hypothetical beings. Even something as abstract as Occam's razor could be a shared philosophical standpoint, for these ideas are not confined to the human condition.

Our speculations are, of course, guided by the light of curiosity rather than certainty. The nature of intelligence in the universe is a mystery as profound as the cosmic ocean itself. My intention here is not to sail into that uncharted territory but to cast a beacon towards a target, a standard of truth that transcends mere mathematics or physics, embracing those universal truths that we might share with other sentient beings.

When navigating the cosmic sea of alien truth, we must approach with a sense of wonder and openness. If a concept, such as justice, could conceivably be a shared understanding, that is enough to ponder its universal nature. I would not wager that every intelligent life form would perceive justice as we do, but neither would I dismiss the possibility.

The notion of alien truth finds kinship with Erdos's enchanting metaphor of God's book, where he likened a superb proof to a celestial discovery, signifying (a) that a profound proof is more unearthed than created, and (b) that its brilliance would be recognized across the cosmos. If alien truth is real, then God's book contains chapters beyond mathematics.

What shall we name this cosmic quest for extraterrestrial truth? Perhaps "philosophy" suffices, for within the philosophical realm, we find the exploration of universal understanding. I believe the great minds of our past, such as Aristotle, would agree with this cosmic endeavor. The search for alien truth might even define philosophy itself. The title matters little; the quest is the essence.

In the future, we may encounter a form of intelligence akin to alien life through artificial creations. This may grant us the ability to discern the truths that intelligent life must comprehend. Perhaps we will find that intelligence, as we understand it, requires principles like Occam's razor, and we may even substantiate that claim. While this inquiry would be a celestial dance, it is not crucial to our immediate exploration. The aim of philosophy, if we choose to call it that, is to probe the ideas that emerge when aiming at alien truth, not to delineate its exact boundaries. These inquiries may one day align, but until that cosmic alignment occurs, we should explore without constraint. This may be an area where our cosmic intuition proves astonishingly accurate. (The universe may yet reveal this to us.)

Whatever name we bestow upon it, the cosmic quest to uncover alien truths is a journey worth embarking upon. And perhaps, in a poetic twist, this very statement is itself an alien truth.
